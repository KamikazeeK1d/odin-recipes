This is the first project I am doing on the Odin Project which requires me to develop a recipes website which compiles a number of recipes that I have chosen to include on my first project. Some of the skills that I will have displayed in this project are setting a HTML webpage up with the boilerplate content, placing content into the webpage, linking to other pages on the website, and also placing images onto webpages.
